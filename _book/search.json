While this mostly isn’t a problem when working on small-scale projects, this approach won’t work anymore once you work on your empirical theses (e.g., for Marketing Analytics), or join an analytics-focused company.\nTherefore, in this course, you will professionalize your way-of-working. In particular, we’ll zoom in on complex, reproducible data preparation workflows (think of structured and unstructured raw data, derived from multiple sources, provided in multiple delivery batches, with lots of missing data, etc.).\nThroughout the course, you’ll be using open science principles documented at Tilburg Science Hub.",
